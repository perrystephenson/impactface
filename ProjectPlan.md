# Project Plan

_This document will cover the planning aspects for the first phase of this project, specifically the iLab project being undertaken by Perry Stephenson in Spring Semester 2016. The project will likely be handed back to Simon Knight following the completion of the iLab subject, and this project plan makes the assumption (below) that the project will be picked up again by another student in a future iLab._

## Client Requirements and Objectives

This project (as posed by the client Simon Knight) is predominantly an exploratory analysis of one or more large academic writing datasets. As an entirely academic pursuit the project is focused entirely on insight discovery, and discussions with the client have not identified any formal requirements other than the implied requirements for high-quality analysis and documentation. The client has identified some potential outcomes from the analysis which will form a loose set of objectives:

* help researchers understand how the language used in academic contexts differs from common use
* flag opportunities for sections of text which should be reviewed to improve the quality of academic writing
* identify opportunities for collaboration between researchers working on similar topics

Whilst each of these objectives is entirely possible to achieve, it is unlikely that I will be able to achieve all of them in a single university semester. Additionally, these outcomes are not exhaustive and new objectives may be identified as the project progresses. This implies some key guiding principles for the project:

* the project must be managed and documented in such a way that future students can continue in future iLab semesters, ideally with minimal re-work
* finishing one thing well is more important than starting on many things

These principles give the client the best chance of benefiting from productive and fruitful iLab projects in future.
