# Project Plan

###Impact McImpactface

_This document will cover the planning aspects for the first phase of this project, specifically the iLab project being undertaken by Perry Stephenson in Spring Semester 2016. The project will likely be handed back to Simon Knight following the completion of the iLab subject, and this project plan makes the assumption that the project will be picked up again by another student in a future iLab._
