# Impact McImpactface
A.K.A. The Derek Zoolander Centre for Researchers Who Canâ€™t Impact Case Study Good

This repo will contain both code and documentation for my Impact McImpactface project, which is being completed as part of the Master of Data Science and Innovation "iLab 1" subject. Using Git for both code and documentation will allow version control for both elements, and will allow future students engaging with this challenge (future MDSI students) to simply fork the repository and start working.
