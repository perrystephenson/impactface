# Data Science Hygiene

_A modest proposal for a standard set of healthy data science habits._

Hygiene is a term most frequently used in relation to our cleaning and grooming habits and rituals, but it is also commonly used for positive habits in other areas of our lives.

Defining a new but similar term, _**data science hygiene**_, should be fairly straight forward.

> **data science hygiene** (noun) _/ˈdeɪtə ˈsaɪəns ˈhaɪdʒin/_
> 
> 1. the habits and practices which maintain good quality data science experiments, analyses, tools and processes.

The habits and practices which collectively make up _**data science hygiene**_ should be:

* Easy and achievable for data scientists at all levels of experience
* Impactful
* Tool and process agnostic
* As general as possible

With these in mind, I propose the following checklist for _**data science hygiene**_.

### 1. Use source control
Using source control gives you a number of benefits which would otherwise be included as _**data science hygiene**_ practices:

* Version management and history
* Collaborative editing and merge conflict resolution
* Code review processes
* Remote backup
* Reproducibility

Source control doesn't just apply to code. Most source control systems can handle many diverse file types, which means you can include documentation or even
