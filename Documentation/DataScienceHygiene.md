# Data Science Hygiene

This project existed before I came along, and it will likely exist after I submit my work for assessment at the end of the semester. Whilst I'm not part of a team *now*, I will eventually be part of a virtual team, and my future team members are relying on me to kick things off in a responsible fashion. This means I need to be careful about how I document my research, write my code, present my work, track my progress, and generally manage the project. 

This document will cover my efforts to identify, create and record best practice data science hygiene practices. I will refrain from defining data science hygiene at this point, except to note that it is different to "data hygiene", which is more about data cleaning. The hygiene analogy should do most of the heavy lifting in terms of a definition:
* Good (data science) hygiene prevents the spread of disease (bugs)
* Bad (data science) hygiene often leads to things smelling off (results)
* Good hygiene comes from forming good habits early
* Bad hygiene gets a lot more attention than good hygiene
* etc

This body of work was inspired partly by [this blog post](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/joel-test-data-science/?imm_mid=0e6f40&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_20160824) where the author proposes a "highly irresponsible sloppy test to rate the quality of a data science team". The test consists of eight questions:

1. Can new hires get set up in the environment to run analyses on their first day?
2. Can data scientists utilize the latest tools/packages without help from IT?
3. Can data scientists use on-demand and scalable compute resources without help from IT/dev ops?
4. Can data scientists find and reproduce past experiments and results, using the original code, data, parameters, and software versions?
5. Does collaboration happen through a system other than email?
6. Can predictive models be deployed to production without custom engineering or infrastructure work?
7. Is there a single place to search for past research and reusable data sets, code, etc?
8. Do your data scientists use the best tools money can buy?

Obviously most of these will not be relevant to my project, however there are a few that stood out for me as examples of "best practice":
* Can data scientists find and reproduce past experiments and results, using the original code, data, parameters, and software versions?
* Does collaboration happen through a system other than email?
* Is there a single place to search for past research and reusable data sets, code, etc?

I then went back and took a look at the blog post from 2000 which inspired the above test, which was the original [Joel Test](http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html) - a "highly irresponsible, sloppy test to rate the quality of a software team". This test has 12 questions so I won't include them all here, but I will call out the ones I think are important for Data Science Hygiene:
* Do you use source control?
* Can you make a build in one step?
* Do you have a bug database?
* Do you have an up-to-date schedule?

I also did some highly targeted "Google researching" and found that [no one is really talking about data science hygiene](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=data+science+hygiene). I found a few posts related to code hygiene - whilst similar, data science is far more broad than coding. It looks like I'll be cutting a path all by myself!
