# Understanding Text Mining

Text Mining is a huge field. Knowing where to start on a text-based data science project is impossible without an understanding of what techniques are available, and what sort of problems they can be used to solve. This document is an attempt to scope out the field, but with a specific focus on the tasks involved in this iLab project. They key features of this project as they relate to the selection of text mining approaches are:

* Approximately 6,000 records
* No labels available
* Several paragraphs of text
* Text is highly edited and reviewed, and likely to be fairly consistent

## NLP and Text Mining

Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text Mining are often used interchangeably. Broadly, Text Mining (and Text Retrieval) are associated with large bodies of text, and utilise techniques which scale well to large datasets. NLP techniques on the other hand are associated with deeper analysis of the text, and involves a lot more human interaction. NLP techniques tend not to scale, where Text Mining techniques are all about scale.

## Text Retrieval and Text Mining

These seem to be two different things. The [Coursera Text Mining](https://www.coursera.org/learn/text-mining) course indicated that "Text Retrieval" is used to search through a "big data" dataset and find a workable set of "relevant" data. Text Mining is then used to find useful knowledge from this corpus of relevant data.

Given the dataset is only 6,000 records, it seems that text retrieval techniques are overkill for this iLab project. For the sake of completion it still makes sense to understand the techniques available in text retrieval and the associated use-cases.
